A resource for student workers in the ITS Information Security team.

I wanted to create a site student workers could reference relating to the information security analyst position.

I took this as an opportunity to make an overkill VPC in which to host my site.

Tools/Services used:
AWS - IAAS (Cloud Provider)
Terraform - IAC (Initialize vpc infrastructure)
Apache HTTPD - Server to host website
Jekyll (Static Site Generator) - Build site
